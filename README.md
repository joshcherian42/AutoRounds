This code is for the prototype monitoring system (AutoRounds) used in <strong>A Step Toward Better Care: Understanding What Assisted Living Facilities' Caregivers and Residents Value in Health Monitoring Systems</strong> which has been accepted at CSCW '24. In this work, we explored the potential utility of monitoring technology in formal caregiving environments, specifically employing a multi-stage, qualitative approach to further understand the needs of caregivers working in and older adults residing in Assisted Living Facilities. We developed this system based on insights gleaned from the thematic analysis of initial interviews with caregivers and subsequently utilized this interface as a means of gaining deeper insights into the potential for such systems to improve the current caregiving paradigm.
